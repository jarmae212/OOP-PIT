Name: Word Counter
Purpose: This desktop app helps users count the number of words and characters in a text. It also allows checking if a specific word is present and keeps a history of the text entries.
Features
Word & Character Counter – Counts how many words and characters are in the text area.
Word Checker – Tells if a word exists in the entered text.
Editable History – Saves previously entered texts in a scrollable list that can be edited.
Save & Load History – Automatically saves history using local storage and lets users update the saved list.
Clear Functions – Clear text, clear all history, or clear specific fields.
Menu Bar – Includes Help (how to use) and About (app info).
Cute Hello Kitty Theme – Soft pink colors and a simple design.

Known Bugs or Areas for Improvement
HIstory Text Format – If the user edits the history badly (e.g., deletes numbering or uses wrong format), it may not save properly.
No Undo Option – There's no way to undo changes after clearing or saving.
No Search Highlight – Word checking only shows a message; it doesn’t highlight the word in the text.
Limited Layout Scaling – On small screens, the UI may not resize well.

Future Ideas:
Add highlighting for found words.
Add export to file (like .txt).
Show date/time of saved history entries.
Improve error messages for better user feedback.
